# Accessing National Library of Estonia Collections workshop

This notebook presents a pilot workflow on accessing digitized newspaper data in the National Library of Estonia. The collection currently includes 386,950 issues from 2200 periodical publications (including journals, magazines and newspapers). This amounts to a total of 3,635,503 pages of text and 6,298,369 articles segmented from this. Some of these texts are free to access, others need to follow some access restrictions due to copyright and other legal requirements. This notebook connects to a subsample of freely accessible texts, amounting to ~1,000,000 articles.
